## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of `nerd_fonts_installer` seriously. If you have found a security vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue.

### How to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities by using the **"Report a vulnerability"** button in the **Security** tab of this repository, if available. This allows for a private disclosure and collaboration process.

If that option is not available, please contact the repository owner directly or open an issue asking for a private communication channel without disclosing the details of the vulnerability.

*   The version of the project you are using.
*   The operating system and environment.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   A description of the impact.
